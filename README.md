# Graph alghoritms project
The aim of this project is to solve minimal spanning tree and shortest path problems with my own implementation of Prim, Kruskal and Dijkstra alghorithms.
Program provides functions such as loading graph from file, getting random graph, setting graph density, time measurement,
sending output to .csv file, automatic testing.
